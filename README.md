## ðŸ—‘ DropCSS

An exceptionally fast, thorough and tiny unused-CSS cleaner _(MIT Licensed)_

---
### Introduction

DropCSS is an exceptionally fast, thorough and tiny ([~7.5 KB min](https://github.com/leeoniya/dropcss/tree/master/dist/dropcss.min.js)) unused-CSS cleaner; it takes your HTML and CSS as input and returns only the used CSS as output. Its custom HTML and CSS parsers are highly optimized for the 99% use case and thus avoid the overhead of handling malformed markup or stylesheets, so you must provide well-formed input. There is minimal handling for complex escaping rules, so there will always exist cases of valid input that cannot be processed by DropCSS; for these infrequent cases, please [start a discussion](https://github.com/leeoniya/dropcss/issues), use a previous, larger and slower [0.3.x version](https://github.com/leeoniya/dropcss/releases) that uses heavier but more compliant parsers, or use an alternative CSS cleaner.

It is recommended to also run your CSS through a structural optimizer like [clean-css](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css), [csso](https://github.com/css/csso), [cssnano](https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano) or [crass](https://github.com/mattbasta/crass) to group selectors, merge and remove redundant rules, purge unused keyframes, etc.

A bit more on this project's backstory & discussions in [/r/javascript](https://old.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/b3mcu8/dropcss_010_a_minimal_and_thorough_unused_css/) and on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19469080).

### Installation

```
npm install -D dropcss
```

---
### Usage & API

```js
const dropcss = require('dropcss');

let html = `
    <html>
        <head></head>
        <body>
            <p>Hello World!</p>
        </body>
    </html>
`;

let css = `
    .card {
      padding: 8px;
    }

    p:hover a:first-child {
      color: red;
    }
`;

const whitelist = /#foo|\.bar/;

let cleaned = dropcss({
    html,
    css,
    keepText: false,
    shouldKeep: sel => whitelist.test(sel),
});

console.log(cleaned.css);
```

- `shouldKeep` is called for every CSS selector that could not be matched in the `html`. Return `true` to retain it or `false` to drop it.
- `keepText` - By default, DropCSS will remove all text nodes from the HTML before processing further since very few CSS selectors can actually target text. Not having to process text nodes is a significant performance boost. However, a few uncommon pseudo-classes like `:blank` and `:empty` do assert on text nodes. If combined as e.g. `:not(:empty)`, this could result wrongful removal, or wrongful retention of selectors. Setting `keepText` to `true` will leave all text nodes in place to allow for this to work properly at the expense of performance.

### Features

- Supported Selectors

  - `*` (universal)
  - `a` (tag)
  - `#` (id)
  - `.` (class)
  - ` ` (descendant)
  - `>` (child)
  - `+` (adjacent sibling)
  - `~` (general sibling)
  - `[attr]` (attribute)
  - `[attr=val]`
  - `[attr*=val]`
  - `[attr^=val]`
  - `[attr$=val]`
  - `:not()`
  - `:empty`
  - `:first-child`
  - `:last-child`
  - `:only-child`
  - `:nth-child()`
  - `:nth-last-child()`

- Retention of all transient pseudo-class and pseudo-element selectors which cannot be deterministically checked from the parsed HTML.

---
### TODO

- Removal of unused @keyframes and @font-face - this is technically out of scope for this project since it's purely an in-css structural optimization, but few CSS optimizers actually do it and it can save quite a few bytes. [Issue #5](https://github.com/leeoniya/dropcss/issues/5).
- All `-of-type` selectors are currently unimplemented, so will not be removed unless already disqualified by a paired selector, (e.g. `.card:first-of-type` when `.card` is absent altogether). [Issue #4](https://github.com/leeoniya/dropcss/issues/4).
  - `:first-of-type`
  - `:last-of-type`
  - `:only-of-type`
  - `:nth-of-type()`
  - `:nth-last-of-type()`
  - `:nth-only-of-type()`

Both of these are pretty easy to implement and a good first issues for those interested in contributing.

### Performance

#### Input

**test.html**

- 18.8 KB minified
- 502 dom nodes via `document.querySelectorAll("*").length`

**styles.min.css**

- 27.67 KB combined, optimized and minified via [clean-css](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css)
- contents: Bootstrap's [reboot.css](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/dist/css/bootstrap-reboot.css), an in-house flexbox grid, global layout, navbars, colors & page-specific styles. (the grid accounts for ~85% of this starting weight, lots of media queries & repetition)

</table>

**Notes**

- About 400 "unused bytes" are due to an explicit/shared whitelist, not an inability of the tools to detect/remove that CSS.
- About 175 "unused bytes" are due to vendor-prefixed (-moz, -ms) properties & selectors that are inactive in Chrome, which is used for testing coverage.
- Purgecss does not support attribute or complex selectors: [Issue #110](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss/issues/110).

A full **[Stress Test](https://github.com/leeoniya/dropcss/tree/master/test/bench)** is also available.

### Caveats

- Not tested against malformed HTML or CSS
- There is no processing or execution of `<script>` tags; your HTML must be fully formed (or SSR'd). You should generate and append any additional HTML that you'd want to be considered by DropCSS. If you need JS execution, consider using the larger, slower but still good output, `UnCSS`. Alternatively, [Puppeteer can now output coverage reports](https://www.philkrie.me/2018/07/04/extracting-coverage.html), and there might be tools that utilize this coverage data to clean your CSS, too. DropCSS aims to be minimal, simple and effective.

### Acknowledgements

- Felix BÃ¶hm's [nth-check](https://github.com/fb55/nth-check) - it's not much code, but getting `An+B` expression testing exactly right is frustrating. I got part-way there before discovering this tiny solution.
- Vadim Kiryukhin's [vkbeautify](https://github.com/vkiryukhin/vkBeautify) - the benchmark and test code uses this tiny formatter to make it easier to spot differences in output diffs.
